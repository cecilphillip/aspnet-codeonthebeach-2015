ASP .NET MVC 6 Samples
================================


The demos in this repo were created for my talk at [Code On The Beach](https://www.codeonthebeach.com) 2015 "ASP .NET MVC 6 and the new .NET Web Stack". Feel free to fork, submit an issue if you have questions, or even send a pull request :D.

Getting Setup
-------------

The [ASPNET Home](https://github.com/aspnet/home#getting-started-on-windows) repo on Github should have what you need to get the ASP .NET 5 runtime installed on your machine.

The samples were written with beta6 of the runtime. Running *dnvm install 1.0.0-beta6* in your command prompt should pull down the correct version



 Some of the samples use Ecmascript 6 syntax so the project is setup to be transpiled using Babel.
